Key and Certificate Management Reference Architecture

In this assignment, I designed and developed a reference architecture workflow for Key and Certificate Management. 
The reference architecture addressed the entire certificate lifecycle, starting from initial generation, through emergency revocation, and ending with end-of-life processes.
The goal was to ensure and demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of managing digital certificates and cryptographic keys, including processes for security, compliance, and operational efficiency in real-world systems.
